You think this is functional? You think it will be functional by the end of this Hackathon?? Think Again! :D

# Were-bot, or Where-bot?????

You have stumbled upon a project made by a group of first-years in UQ, and they are terrible at debugging and cooperating. 

Imagean deciding on making a discord bot in python with only 6 months of experience in python.

Appearently, there are something called async function, which are like regular funcitons but are more of a jerk.

The first day is purely searching up tutorial all over internet. 

"I had only slept for 6 hours in these two days" - by Amy

"AAAAAAAAAfgdyshjzdcjaysukjzygfvjgcaskghvfguyakhdghfcvkaghdjsg what are classes I haven't finished my introductory python course" - K

"why did we choose to make a discord bot when none of us knew how to make a discord bot?" - Ryan

"testing the same code with different bots at the same time is not a good idea (insert bots echoing each other)" - Bahareh

# What does it do?
The Were-bot is a discord bot that allows you to play the werewolf game (aka mafia) in your own discord server!

Supposedly.

The most significant function is to make everyone in the dev team suffer :)

## List of commands

Typing 'Make me some threads' when Were-bot is online will kidnap every single person in the server into a game of Werewolf.

Typing 'Clear all threads' will delete all the threads (including the ones that are originallly in the server)

Nobody knows if the command 'Delete thread {int}' will work anymore. "I'm a little scared to figure out if it does." -K


## How does the game work?
Poorly

By typing 'Make me some threads' it will pull people into the game and initiate games. By people we include those that are offline. So don't worry about not being able to find friend to play with, with Werebot, NO ONE CAN ESCAPE (you can by leaving threads actually)

Game starts with night, Werewolves have 15 seconds to discuss who to kill next, and have 30 secs to vote.

After then it is the day, and villagers are supposed to vote out the werewolves amoung them, with a time equivanlently short.

The game continues until enough player have died so either werewolves have equal or more members than villagers, or all werewolves are voted out.


##
we have attempted at making /commands for quick access and make join game buttons, but the buttons won't work and we ran out of time.
We may attempt to implement it in UQ CS bot in the future (Once we get rid of all the bugs)
